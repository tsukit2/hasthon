This is an ambitious attempt to implement Python language in Haskell. This primary purpose is to create an alternative to CPython that hopefully runs as fast but doesn't suffer from global interpreter lock. The secondary goal is to prove that we can apply pure static functional programming language like Haskell in implementing dynamic imperative language like Python.

This project is on hold due to my employment restrictions.
